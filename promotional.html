        Goal
        <article>
            Our goal, precisely, is to help all people communicate more easily so they can gain more friends or be able to converse with random people with ease, as well as increase self-esteem, both of which the audience can benefit from.<br><br>
            
            People tend to lack socialization skills these days especially since social media is a thing now and people can communicate with each other without meeting in person. Thus, we aim to improve how people socialize in real life.
